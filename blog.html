              1.Difference between var let and const
            </button>

              The var keyword is the oldest way of declaring variables in
              JavaScript and is supported by all browsers. The let and const
              keywords are newer additions to the language and are not supported
              by older browsers. If you need to support older browsers, you can
              use var instead of let or const. If you donot need to support
              older browsers, you can use let or const. If you want your
              variable to be immutable, use const. As you can see, var and let
              variables can be reassigned, but const variables can not. Another
              difference between var and let/const is that var variables are
              function-scoped, while let and const variables are block-scoped.
              This means that var variables are only available within the
              function they were declared in. On the other hand, let and const
              variables are only available within the block they were declared
              in. So, to sum up, the main differences between var, let and const
              are: var is function-scoped while let and const are block-scoped.
              var variables can be reassigned while let and const variables can
              not. var variables are declared using the var keyword while let
              and const variables are declared using the let and const keywords
              respectively. const variables are immutable while let and var
              variables are not.

              This article discusses the major differences between the regular
              functions and the arrow functions. Arrow functions a new feature
              introduced in ES6 enable writing concise functions in JavaScript.
              While both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner,
              yet there are certain interesting differences between them

              Map executes the same code on every element in an array and
              returns a new array with the updated elements.<br />
              ForEash is used to execute the same code on every element in an
              array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.<br />
              Filterchecks every element in an array to see if it meets a
              certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that
              return truthy for the criteria.
